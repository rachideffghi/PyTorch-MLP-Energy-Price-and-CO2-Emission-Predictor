# PyTorch-MLP-Energy-Price-and-CO2-Emission-Predictor

## Objective
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict "Price (EUR/MWhe)" based on several input features: 'Country', 'Energy, Electricity Production, Index', 'Industrial Production Index', 'Unemployment Rate', and 'Inflation Rate'. The primary machine learning model employed in this project is a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), implemented using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The main objective is to construct a model capable of accurately predicting energy prices by leveraging the provided dataset and its associated features.
