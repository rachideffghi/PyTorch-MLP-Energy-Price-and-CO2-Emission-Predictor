# PyTorch-MLP-Energy-Price-and-CO2-Emission-Predictor


This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict "Price (EUR/MWhe)" based on several input features: 'Country', 'Energy, Electricity Production, Index', 'Industrial Production Index', 'Unemployment Rate', and 'Inflation Rate'.

The primary machine learning model employed in this project is a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), implemented using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. 

The main objective is to construct a model capable of accurately predicting energy prices by leveraging the provided dataset and its associated features.


# Scaling for Large-Scale Implementation

This project has the potential to be scaled up for large-scale applications
### 1. Handling Big Data

For large-scale applications, it's essential to efficiently manage and store extensive datasets. Implement distributed data storage solutions and databases capable of handling high data volumes.

### 2. Model Adaptation

As data volume grows, consider adapting the MLP model's architecture and complexity to effectively capture the nuances of the expanded dataset.

### 3. Parallel Processing

Leverage parallel processing and distributed computing resources for faster model training and inference. Explore techniques like data parallelism on GPU or TPU clusters.

### 4. Containerization and Orchestration

When deploying the model at scale, utilize containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes to ensure consistent and scalable deployment across multiple servers or cloud instances.

### CI/CD Integration

Implement automated pipelines for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. This facilitates continuous updates, ensuring the model remains current with new data and insights, and is ready for large-scale real-world applications.
